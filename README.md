All the Tango Weekends in a Year as open data

## Motivation

There are dozens of Tango listings of festivals, marathons, holidays, etc, complete with maps, calendars, cross references to DJs and maestros.  But there is one problem: the data is constantly being changed by organisers, and all the information becomes useless at the end of the year.

So we suggest, let's put the data creation effort in one single repo, and make it easy to import the data to apps and website.

## Copyright

The data in this calendar is crowdsourced.  There is no restriction to how the data can be reused.

## Who is using this data?
